# MURAI
MURAI stands for **MURAI Urai Rumus Akal Ilham**. *Urai* means to disentangle. *Rumus* means to formulate. *Akal* means reason as in *human is bestowed with reason*. And *ilham* means inspiration. Those are Malay words. In a phrase, MURAI means to disentangle and to formulate with reason and inspiration. [Murai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-rumped_shama) is also a species of songbird.

MURAI is a programming language based on [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language)'s keywords and messages. The programming language is designed for those who *think* in Malay which is an official language in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. Malay is spoken by 290 million people. MURAI is meant to be as powerful as other programming languages. The reasoning behind developing MURAI is that no single programming language can cope with software entropy. New programming languages will emerge to fit into new system thinking. Even though it is considered late in the race, MURAI is still within the era of programming language evolution.

This repository is purposely written in English so that English-thinking programmers can participate in developing MURAI because we have yet to evolve Malay-thinking programmers. In fact, MURAI development is strictly encoded, commented and documented in English.
