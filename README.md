# MURAI
MURAI stands for **MURAI Urai Rumus Akal Ilham**. *Urai* means to disentangle. *Rumus* means to formulate. *Akal* means reason as in *human is bestowed with reason*. And *ilham* means inspiration. Those are Malay words. In a phrase, MURAI means to disentangle and to formulate with reason and inspiration. [Murai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-rumped_shama) is also a species of songbird.

MURAI is a programming language based on [Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language)'s keywords and messages. The programming language is designed for those who *think* in Malay which is an official language in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. Malay is spoken by 290 million people. MURAI is meant to be as powerful as other programming languages. The reasoning behind developing MURAI is that no single programming language can cope with software entropy. New programming languages will emerge to fit into new system thinking. Even though it is considered late in the race, MURAI is still within the era of programming language evolution.

This repository is purposely written in English so that English-*thinking* programmers can participate in developing MURAI because we have yet to evolve Malay-*thinking* programmers. In fact, MURAI development is strictly encoded, commented and documented in English.

## The Language Construct
MURAI is a dialect of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) with [C structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)). It looks like a C language embedded in Lisp parentheses, and behaves mostly like Lisp. There are only two major high-level programming language families - Lisp and C. Lisp has the simplest form and notation. And C introduced structured programming. MURAI takes the advantage of both worlds.

## Performance vs Adaptability
Nowadays, system performance is scalable. The main challenge of a new programming language is adaptability. MURAI was designed for minimal system requirement. Most cheap or free shared web hosting services will be able to run MURAI. No dedicated server or virtual machine is required. Yes, MURAI can be used to develop web applications.

Most shared web hosting services allow Apache, PHP and MySQL. They are constraints but sufficient to run web applications. Hence, MURAI was developed using PHP for merely the sake of adaptability. MURAI is an interpreted programming language that can run all PHP functions. MURAI programmer does not have to learn PHP.

This is not a novelty or a supremacy argument. There is no main-stream Malay programming language. In fact, there is no remotely-known Malay programming language (anyone may argue on this one). MURAI is an experiment to create a Malay programming language. All approaches must be practical and predictable from square one.
